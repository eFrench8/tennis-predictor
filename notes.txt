need to get a dataset with stuff about the player
name, age, height, wins, preffered court (hard, grass, clay), what hand they play with
ive found this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dissfya/atp-tennis-2000-2023daily-pull/data

was gonna do a random forest model but realised it was to basic for how much detail i wanted to use
so were gonna use pytorch and create a neural network
